ONCE upon a TIME you dressed so FINE
THREW the bums a DIME in your PRIME
DIDNT YOU
people CALL say BEWARE DOLL youre BOUND to FALL
you thought THEY were ALL
KIDDING YOU

YOU USED TO
LAUGH ABOUT
EVERYBODY that WAS
HANGING OUT
NOW you DON'T
TALK so LOUD
NOW you DON'T
SEEM so PROUD
ABOUT having to be SCROUNGING
your NEXT MEAL

[CHORUS]

HOW does it FEEL
HOW does it FEEL
to be WITHOUT a HOME
like a COMPLETE UNKNOWN
like a ROLLING STONE

Recurse is the debut studio album released by American electro-industrial band Finite Automata.  It was released on December 29, 2012, by Beyond Therapy Records in digital format, and released on compact disc on February 22, 2013.
The album features reworked and re-recorded material from the group's previous demo-release Here Won No One, as well as reworked material written between 2007 and 2010. Its name is a reference to the computer science concept of recursion, and alludes to conflict that feeds back into itself.
